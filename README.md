This is a cuberite plugin that adds a random spawn system that spawns players based on config in a random area

what works:
 - spawning in a random location after death
 - spawning in a random location when logging in(toggleable)

what does not work:
 - spawning in a random location when logging in for the first time(toggleable)
 - spawning on a command (togleable)

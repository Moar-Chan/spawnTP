This is a cuberite plugin that adds a random spawn system that spawns players based on config in a random area, it won't get breaking changes in the forseeable future but its under constant development and the mos basic of stuff has not been fully implimented yet.

what works:
 - spawning in a random location after death
 - spawning in a random location when logging in(toggleable)

what does not work:
 - spawning in a random location when logging in for the first time(toggleable)
 - spawning on a command (togleable)

Why doe the things not work:
  Random spawn on first login:
    - sqlite getting the amount of rows of ids in a nummber is not really working so 
  Random spawn on command:
    - Simply not implimented at all
